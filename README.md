# UVLED-Disinfection-Robot
This repository contains the code used for a UV LED Disinfection Robot MEng Project. It contains draft code and testing code for controlling an iRobot Create2 to detect and traverse table undersides while illuminating a set of LEDs to simulate cleaning with UV LEDs. Other hardware needed include a robotic arm, two IR sensors, and an ultraosound sensor. 

The final version of the table traversal/cleaning algorithm can be founded in "/4_17_demo/demo.py". Object recognition through color recognition is found in the folder "/color_recogn". Code should be able to run when downloaded without extra libraries.
